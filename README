* ABOUT

Irssi has many features, prominent of which is the ability to customise it.
Unfortunately, creating a theme can be difficult without trial and error and/or
a large time investment.

The purpose of this project is to document the theme creating process to save
the end-user some hassle and time.

* FILES

README - the file you are reading
default.theme - the default theme shipped with irssi

* COMPATIBILITY

This document was designed for irssi versions 0.8.13 - 0.8.14 in mind. Older
versions (and newer ones) may work but YMMV.
